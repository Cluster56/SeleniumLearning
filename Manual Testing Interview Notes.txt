✅ Manual Testing Interview Notes – Full Copy

1. What is Testing?
- Testing ensures the software works as expected, meets business needs, and is bug-free.

2. STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
- Phases: Requirement Analysis → Test Planning → Test Case Design → Test Environment Setup → Test Execution → Test Closure

3. Test Plan
- A detailed document describing scope, strategy, team, timelines, resources, tools, and risk for testing.

4. Test Strategy
- High-level company-wide document describing how testing is handled across projects (tools, environments, roles, etc.)

5. Black Box vs White Box
- Black Box: Tester doesn't need code knowledge, tests functionality.
- White Box: Developer tests internal logic/structure of code.

6. Priority vs Severity
- Priority = Urgency to fix
- Severity = Impact of defect on system

7. Bug vs Defect
- Defect = Deviation from requirement (by tester)
- Bug = Same issue, usually after release or common term
- Failure = When the end-user faces it

8. Types of Testing
- Unit Testing → Dev-only, individual functions
- Integration Testing → Interaction between modules
- Interface Testing → API & system-to-system
- System Testing → Full application
- End-to-End Testing → Real user workflow
- Regression Testing → Rechecking existing features
- Smoke Testing → Basic functionality check
- Sanity Testing → Quick testing of new fixes
- Ad-hoc/Exploratory Testing → Informal/random tests

9. Defect Life Cycle
- New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Verified → Closed
- Rejected/Duplicate/Deferred possible based on situation

10. Defect Management
- Process of logging, triaging, fixing, retesting, and closing defects using tools like JIRA

11. RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
- Finding the *why* behind a bug using “5 Whys” or fishbone method

12. Test Case vs Test Scenario
- Scenario = High-level "what to test"
- Case = Step-by-step "how to test" with input, expected result

13. Test Data & Test Environment
- Test Data = Input used during testing (valid/invalid/boundary/null)
- Test Env = Complete setup (servers, apps, test data, APIs, DB, etc.)

14. Entry & Exit Criteria
- Entry = Conditions to start testing (env ready, build stable)
- Exit = Conditions to stop testing (all cases run, bugs fixed)

15. QA vs QC
- QA = Process-focused, prevents bugs (planning, reviews)
- QC = Product-focused, finds bugs (test execution)

16. Static vs Dynamic Testing
- Static = Without executing code (reviews, walkthroughs)
- Dynamic = By executing code (manual, automation)

17. Verification vs Validation
- Verification = Are we building the product right? (process)
- Validation = Are we building the right product? (result)

18. RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix)
- A table that maps requirements → test cases → status → defects

19. Exploratory vs Ad-hoc Testing
- Exploratory = Skilled, learning while testing (semi-structured)
- Ad-hoc = Random, informal, unplanned testing

✨ You're interview-ready, bro!
